# MR. MISSLE 🎮

A 2D top-down bullet hell game created for a game jam!

## Game Concept
**Genre:** Bullet Hell  
**Rule:** 1 HP for everyone

## How It Works
- **You have 1 HP** - One hit from any bullet and you die!
- **Boss has 1 HP** - Touch the boss once to win!
- **Dodge massive bullet patterns** while trying to reach the boss
- **Progressive difficulty** - Each level gets harder with more complex patterns

## Controls
- **Move:** WASD or Arrow Keys
- **Start Game:** SPACE (from menu)
- **Restart:** R (after game over)
- **Next Level:** SPACE (after winning)

## Features
- 🎯 Precise hitbox system (small red dot on player)
- 💥 5 different bullet patterns:
  - Spiral
  - Circle
  - Aimed shots
  - Wave pattern
  - Random spray
- 📈 Increasing difficulty with each level
- 🎨 Clean visual design with color-coded elements
- ⚡ Smooth 60 FPS gameplay

## How to Run
```bash
# Compile all Java files
cd src
javac *.java

# Run the game
java App
```

Or use your IDE's run button!

## Tips for Survival
1. Focus on the small red dot - that's your actual hitbox
2. Move smoothly and avoid panicking
3. Stay near the edges to have more escape routes
4. Watch the boss's position to plan your winning touch
5. Each level increases bullet count and fire rate - good luck!

## Game Jam Theme
**Genre:** Bullet Hell  
**Rule:** 1 HP

The game perfectly fits the theme by making every moment matter - one mistake and it's game over, but one successful touch and you win!

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
